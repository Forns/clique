## Clique: A Javascript Linear Algebra Library with Applications to Spectral Analysis

Clique represents a two-sided effort:

1. A generalized, powerful linear algebra library for use in any Javascript application
2. An application of said library to a new statistical method for analyzing trends in large data sets

Although initial eforts involved approval voting data, the present attempt will
expand the possibilities of the statistical technique to analyze a wider
variety of information types while making the tool available to all.
